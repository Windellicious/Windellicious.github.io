        Hey there, My name is Windell aka Windellicious and I am currently attending James Campbell High School as a Senior class of 2020. I was born in the Philippines but my parents settled to hawaii where I was raised. Even though I was raised here in Oahu,HI I am bilingual. I can speak and understand both English and Filipino Language very fluent. I  in a city called Kalihi in Oahu but then moved to Ewa Beach also in Oahu because my parents knew it wasn't a safe place for us. Now I am currently in Ewa Beach living young and wild and free. We came to Hawaii for better opportunities because my parentes knew going to Hawaii will take a lot of effort and attitude to  live happily in Hawaii. After High School I wanna be the most successful man out there and make my parents proud by going to college and major in Architectural Engineering with thebest positive thought and mind.
